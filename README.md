# 🧾 Java Bill Counter Machine

A console-based project that demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Object-Oriented Software Engineering (OOSE)**, and **clean code principles** through a simplified retail billing system.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This Java-based bill counter system replicates the core functions of a billing interface commonly used in retail environments. It is designed to showcase:

- OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Structured design following OOSE practices
- Maintainable and readable code with a focus on clean coding standards

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project serves as a practical demonstration of my understanding and implementation of:

- Object-Oriented Design and Architecture
- Core Java programming principles
- Building modular and easy-to-maintain systems

Though the system is simplified and console-based, it represents the foundation of a scalable billing application.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is intended solely for demonstration purposes. It does not include database connectivity or integration with real-world POS systems. The goal is to focus on **fundamental programming logic** and **best practices** in software development.
