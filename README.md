# Bill-Counter-Machine
Java Bill Counter Machine: A demonstration of OOP, OOSE, and clean code principles in a simple retail bill counter system.

**Project Title:** Java Bill Counter Machine

**Description:**
This project demonstrates my expertise in object-oriented programming (OOP), object-oriented software engineering (OOSE), and adherence to clean code principles. It's a straightforward system that emulates a bill counter machine commonly used in retail settings.

**Purpose:**
The Java Bill Counter Machine showcases my proficiency in designing and implementing well-structured, maintainable software solutions. Despite its simplicity, it serves as a testament to my skills in OOP, OOSE, and clean code principles.

**Disclaimer:**
This project is for demonstration purposes only and does not include database functionality or real-world integration. It focuses on illustrating fundamental programming concepts and best practices in software development.
